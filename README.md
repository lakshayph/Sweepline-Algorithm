# Sweepline Algorithm
This project focuses on reviewing binary search trees and understanding randomized search trees (treaps).
This is a C/C++ program that uses a treap to implement the sweepline algorithm for 2-d closest pairs in expected O(n log n) time.
The input (stdin) to the program is a single line with the number of points (n) followed by the n points as pairs of integer coordinates, one pair per line.
Besides outputting the coordinates of the two closest points, this program should provide performance metrics such as: maximum BST size, CPU time, and the number of rotations.
